Age of Dragons (work in progress)
==============

# Overview

Age of Dragons is a pet project I have running. I have always loved top-down turn-based strategy games (Fire Emblem and Advanced Wars comes to mind), so I decided to attempt to make one myself. This is it.

## Idea

My idea is to make a turn-based strategy game that I feel is as fun as others I have played. The end goal is to give it a rich story with an entertaining gameplay, but also let people slug it versus their friends.

The current goal, however, is to get a working game. All the fancy stuff will come afterwards.

## Choice of programming language

I chose C# as I felt it, with the use of XNA, made it relatively painless to get a game up and running. That, and combination (C#/XNA) is used for making games on the Windows Phone, which is something I’d like to do once I get the hang of it.

## To-do

Here is a list of what I still need to do. It is far from incomplete, and will change depending on what I want to do.
•   Menus.
•   Levels.
•   Make it possible to attack enemies.
•   Implement an actual AI.
•   Story.
•   Tons of other stuff.
•   Revise all the code. Some of it was written before I gained some of the knowledge I have now.
